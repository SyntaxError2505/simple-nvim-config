# Simple Lazy Config
## A lazy.nvim based config for the simple kind of people
My personal lazy based config, optimised for every languge you throw at it and to be maintanable even with the great shift of ideology in nvim 0.11 and onward  

## Dependencies
In vim dependencies will be handled by lazy. Some packages are required to be installed on the machiene using a package manager or following their documentation:  
rigrep (opional. enables telescope to grep trough files)  
lazygit (optional. lazygit gui (<space>gg) will not work without it)
